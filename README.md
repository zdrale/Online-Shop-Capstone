This project is the 8th one in the HTML/CSS module at Microverse, also it is Capstone which means its lats one in this module.

I worked on all the requirements given on this project.

Aligned all elements with float and flex or grid.
Used semantic HTML elements for the header, the main content and the footer.
I styled the elements to look like on the design.
I used some CSS positioning techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
Also I added 3 breakpoints for responsiveness.
